# acg_labs

This repo is to track where doing ACG labs this will probably be done in terraform.

## Format

1) A folder for each course
2) Within the course folder a folder for each lab
3) The course folders are all work that I do
4) The `instructorrepos_submods` is where instructor repos I clone go.
    1) See the README.md in `instructorrepos_submods` to make sure you clone those repos if you want them.
